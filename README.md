# Hardware Development of Illumination and Sensor Board for Multispectral Cameras System 
This project is about hardware development for a vital sign detection device

This is a device that allows patients to take images of wounds at their homes with a higher frequency compared to typical hospital visits. The images would then be made available to their clinicians for continuous wound monitoring.
